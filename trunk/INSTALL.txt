Updating from 1.5.3 to 2.0.0.

	Database changes
	Web page redirection
		- require an .htaccess file which redirects all page requests through index.php
		- require Apache httpd.conf changes to allow redirection i.e. allow override directive is set to all: 
			AllowOverride All
		- Apache module to be loaded: LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so

Updating from 1.5.0 to 1.5.1?  Version 1.5.1 includes updates to the default items within the configuration 
database, but no database schema changes. That means a manual update should be very easy to accomplish:

	1. do a "diff -r --brief" between the new downloaded directory, and the existing 1.5.0 installation
	   copy the files that are different from the new directory to the installed version
	2. copy the .manual_update_151.php to the installed version directory
	3. cd to the installed directory and run it like: "php .manual_update_151.php"
	4. edit the database_credentials.inc file, and change the version to 1.5.1
	5. delete the .manual_update_151.php file

Or, you can do the update via the web browser or command line too.

NEW Installations or Upgrades from versions before 1.5.0

There are two different easy methods available to install or upgrade the 
TimesheetNextGen system: 
	1. Using a web browser
	2. From the command line

I suggest using the web browser because there are more safety checks and a 
couple extra options that aren't available via the command line.

The hard method: manually, instructions are below.


   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<x>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


Web Installation

	1. Copy the distribution files to an active web location, such as 
	   htdocs/www, or an new active virtual website (my favorite option). 

	2. If you are performing an upgrade, then copy the files 
	   "database_credentials.inc" and "table_names.inc" from your previous 
	   installation to this new instance.

	3. Point a browser to this address and follow the instructions there.

UNIX SYSTEMS WITH SHELL ACCESS

To install, run the script:

	install/install.sh

To upgrade from an earlier version, run the script:

	install/upgrade.sh

SERVERS WITHOUT SHELL ACCESS OR WINDOWS SYSTEMS

Manual Installation

1. Extract the distribution files locally, so that you can edit some of them before uploading to your web server

2a. Create a database on the mysql server. 

	This can be done manually if you know how, 
	or by running the script that comes with the distribution.

	First open the "timesheet_create.sql.in" file and replace the following occurrances:

	__DBUSER__ replace with the database username (one with privileges to create databases)
	__DBNAME__ the name of the database you want to create (e.g. "timesheet")
	__DBHOST__ the hostname which mysql is runnning on
	__DBPASS__ the password for the username which will access it
	__DBPASSWORDFUNCTION__ either "SHA1", "PASSWORD" or "OLD_PASSWORD" depending on your version of mysql. (See footnote)

	Now rename it to "timesheet_create.sql"
	and run it. This script is just a list of SQL commands.
	If you don't use this script, be sure to set the privileges on the new database.


2b. (Alternatively) Use an existing database, edit the upgrade sql scripts to replace the table prefixes, and apply them one at a time.
	Edit the table_names.inc file to list all the appropriate table names.
	Skip to step 6.


3. Create the tables

	Open the "timesheet.sql.in" and replace all instances of __TABLE_PREFIX__ 
	with a prefix you would like all tables to start with. This is done so that
	tables like "user" don't conflict with other tables you have in the same database.
	If you have no other tables you can just delete occurances of __TABLE_PREFIX__
	from the file.

	Now rename it to "timesheet.sql". It is just a set of SQL commands to be run from mysql
	or whatever interface you have to it. Make sure you run it on the right database.

4. Enter your database details into the "database_credentials.inc.in" file from the distribution. 
	
	The values you need to set are:

	$DATABASE_HOST - (The hostname of the database - usually 'localhost')
	$DATABASE_USER - (The username which you will connect to the database with)
	$DATABASE_PASS - (The password which you will connect to the database with)
	$DATABASE_DB - (The name of the database you created - usually 'timesheet')
	$DATABASE_PASSWORD_FUNCTION (either "SHA1", "PASSWORD" or "OLD_PASSWORD" depending on your version of mysql. [See footnote])


	These values are not required, but may help an upgrade process in the future
	$TIMESHEET_VERSION   - (The current version of the Timesheet system)
	$TIMESHEET_INSTALLED - (If the Timesheet system is installed, should be the numeral one).

	Now rename this file to "database_credentials.inc"
 
5. Set the admin password for TimesheetNextGen, by running the following SQL command:

	INSERT INTO user (username,level,password,first_name,last_name) VALUES ('admin', 10, PASSWORD('<password>'), 'Timesheet', 'Admin');

	Also run these:

	INSERT INTO assignments VALUES(1,'admin');
	INSERT INTO task_assignments VALUES(1,'admin', '1');

6. Upload the files to your web server.

7. Test the installation by logging in to 'login.php' with the username 'admin', and the <password> entered above.

FOOTNOTE
--------

Due to changes to MySQL in version 4.1, the way that passwords are stored and
accessed has changed. There are 3 different functions and you must choose the
correct one according to your version of MySQL.

You can determine your local version of mysql by typing

mysql --version

You will need to choose one of the folling password functions:

SHA1 (Use this for version 4.1 and later)
PASSWORD (Use this for versions below 4.1)
OLD_PASSWORD (For versions above 4.1 when SHA1 fails)
