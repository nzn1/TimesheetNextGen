 Mixed usage of the daily forms and the simple form has the potential to both
 add time and delete time from a user's entries when time that was originally
 entered with a daily form is then edited with the simple form when the daily
 entries span the end of a week.  

 For instance if a user works from 10pm on Sunday until 3am on Monday, and
 that single entry is made with the daily form, then the simple form is used
 to edit the week ending Sunday, the time from Midnight Monday to 3am will be
 deleted from the user's entries.  

 If, instead, the week beginning Monday is edited, the 3 hours on Monday will
 be added to that task for Monday time EVERY TIME the simple form is saved.  

 It's not easily fixed, but it can be avoided by not allowing both the daily
 and simple forms to be used.
